### Test2 cleanup: remove old V1 chart layer

- Removed the legacy `V1` chart source files from `Test2`
- Removed the old `V1` chart stories from `Test2`
- Kept `Test1` as the place to reference preserved `V1` chart behavior
- Simplified `Test2` so it stays focused on the active `V3` implementation

### Test2 V3: Hover interactions and Storybook control cleanup

- Added shared hover-card support for `V3` charts in `Test2`
- Expanded hover interaction coverage across line, bar, combo, donut, histogram, gauge, pointer scale, map bubble, and sparkline charts
- Improved hover-card placement so cards are less likely to cover the active mark
- Updated `showHoverCard` handling in Storybook controls and restored it as a visible prop with a default value of `false`
- Refreshed sample chart data to better reflect practical product-style scenarios
- Rebuilt `Test2/storybook-static` so local static previews reflect current source changes
